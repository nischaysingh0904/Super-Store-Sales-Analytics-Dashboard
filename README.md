⚡ Executive Overview

This is not just a dashboard.

It is a decision-support system built to simulate how real companies monitor revenue, profit, targets, and regional performance.

Designed with a corporate reporting mindset, this project transforms raw sales data into measurable, strategic business insights.

If 100 dashboards look the same — this one focuses on business impact, KPI logic, and structured modeling.

🎯 Business Objective

Modern businesses don’t fail because of lack of data.
They fail because they don’t convert data into insight.

This dashboard answers critical business questions:

Are we hitting our sales targets?

Which region drives real profit?

Which categories look strong but silently reduce margin?

Where is revenue growing — and where is it slowing down?

What trends demand immediate strategic action?
